# Building Computer Systems with Rust

This repository contains projects aimed at helping you understand the Rust programming language and computer systems more deeply.

**Note:** These projects are for learning purposes and may omit certain parts of actual, full systems to avoid becoming overwhelming.

## Projects

// List your projects here, for example:

1. **CPU**: An implementation of a simple CPU to understand how processors execute instructions and handle data.
2. **Virtual Memory**: An implementation of virtual memory management to learn about memory addressing, paging, and memory protection.
3. **File System**: A simple file system implementation to learn about data storage and organization on disk.
4. **Networking**: A basic network stack implementation to learn about networking protocols, packet handling, and communication.
5. **OS Kernel**: A minimal kernel implementation to understand the basics of operating system development, process management, and system calls.

## Getting Started
1. Install Rust by following the instructions on [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Shahrullo/building-computer-systems-with-rust`
3. Navigate to the project you want to explore and follow the instructions in its README file.
